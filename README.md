I’m a technology entrepreneur, startup advisor, and growth consultant. I previously co-founded the ecommerce platform [**Swell**](https://swell.is). 

I spend much of my time learning about and exploring AI—building new tools, training and finetuning models, and augmenting myself as much as possible. 

Subscribe to my newsletter [**Daily Build**](https://dailybuild.co) where I build new things daily using the latest AI tools.
